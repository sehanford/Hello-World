Writing Time

4:00 a.m. 
The green light flashes.
Too soon to wake,
the neitherland
between night and dawn,
dreams and consciousness.

Yet thoughts arouse me.
My spirit calls for wakefulness.
It’s writing time!

My body stumbles to the desk.
Words fly across the page.
Soon the poem comes to life.
At last, my spirit’s satisfied.

5:00 a.m.
Bemused,
I slide between the sheets.     
In two short hours
the alarm will rouse   
my weary body
from its slumber.
 
To the creative spirit within all of us
